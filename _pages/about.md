I'm a co-founder of [Thesis](https://thesislabs.ai), an applied AI lab building the platform to accelerate scientific discovery. I previously worked at Google X and NVIDIA, and in the Stanford AI Lab with Chelsea Finn and Andrew Ng. I earned an M.S. in Statistics and a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Stanford. My prior work spans pure math, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing, from neural machine translation to autonomous RL for robotics.
